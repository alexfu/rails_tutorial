You've added so many features to your bookstore, but there's so much more you can do!
{% endaside %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
Here are a few of ideas for features you could add to your bookstore.

  1.  Give users the ability to edit their reviews.

  1.  Let users delete their reviews.

  1.  Show when reviews were created or last edited.

  1.  Show a listing of reviews by a given user.

  1.  Add images to books. You're not supposed to judge a book by it's cover...but sometimes it helpful. üòâ

      To add images to books, you will need to use a RubyGem like [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip).

These are just a few ideas. Feel free to be creative and come up with your own features. This is **your** bookstore - I can't tell you what to do...anymore.

  Don't go off into the big, wide world of programming on your own. Even the most seasoned programmer needs a helping hand every once in a  while.

  1.  Join [B'more on Rails](http://bmoreonrails.org/).

      B'more on Rails is a community of folks in and around Baltimore who happen to like Rails. üòä

      We have [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/bmore-on-rails/) three times a month (if it's a Tuesday, there's probably a Meetup üòù)

      Come to the Meetups to get to know other people who are also into Rails. You might meet people like yourself who are just getting started, or you might meet someone who has been working with Rails for a while. We have a pretty good mix of backgrounds and experiences.

  1.  Join B'more on Rails on [Slack](http://bmoreonrails.org/#slack-invite).

      If you haven't heard of Slack, it's kinda like a big group text but *bigger*.

      Slack is a casual place to hangout and chat. It's also a great place to ask questions. üòä

  There are a *ton* of resources available online for anyone who's looking to learn Ruby, Rails, or just about programming. Here are few resources we recommend.

  1.  [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/)

      This is a great series of small and free tutorials for learning more about the Ruby programming languages!

  1.  [The Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl](https://www.railstutorial.org/)

      This tutorial is a much more in depth guide into developing web applications with Rails.

      Note: since you already have Rails installed on your computer, you don't need to use Cloud9 for you development environment.

  1.  [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/)

      The Odin Project offers a series of courses around web development. Along with courses on Ruby and Rails, they have courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
