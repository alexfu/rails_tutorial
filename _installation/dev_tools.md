# Get a Text Editor!
It's time to pick your poison! Either of these text editors are great.

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a great open-source, hackable text editor that's great on all platforms! For Atom, to open a file in the terminal, just type `atom [filename]`.

[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is also a community favorite. For Sublime, to open a file in the terminal, just type `subl [filename]`.

# A Good Command Prompt for Window Users
If you want to be able to `ctrl + v` into your terminal, have syntax highlighting, and be able to have tabs (and more!), download [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)!
